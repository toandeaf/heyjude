// Java is an example of an "object-orientated language" (OOP), basically meaning that we see and treat everything
// within our code as a bunch of objects. "Objects" in this sense, have two main features: they can have behaviours (methods/functions)
// and they can have properties/values

// This is an example of a "Class" within Java, which is how we define our objects.
// Java uses {} (curly bracket) syntax to encapsulate/contain logic.
// With the example below you can see that the definition of the class begins on line 14 where we have the first {
// The definition then ends at the start of line 16, where we have the second }
// NOTE -- If you open a bracket it you must ALWAYS close it, otherwise your code won't compile. Understanding brackets
// and especially embedded ones is tricky at the beginning but it just comes with practice
public class Person
{
    // Class definitions including methods and properties
}

// Generally speaking, and especially at beginner level, we will have one class definition per class FILE. If you want
// to create a new class to use in another class, define it seperately and then import it in. This will be discussed later.
// But to describe classes more, we'll add a second one below

class Test
{ // NOTE -- Java doesn't care about spaces, tabs or how crushed your code is. It will still compile, so how it looks doesn't
  // matter to the COMPILER, but it does matter to the reader/human.
